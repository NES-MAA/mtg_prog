<p>Abstract: In the past few yearsâ€™ people have been trying to cut down on smoking habits for health reasons. It seems to be one of the hardest habits to break for people. So what causes people to smoke so much? In this study we are trying to figure out the relationship between smoking habits, gender and race. We are also curious to see if the hours someone works a week affects how much someone has smoked.</p>
