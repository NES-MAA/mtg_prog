<p>Abstract: This is a statistical analysis studying the relationships between attendance at technical/vocational schools, two-year colleges, four-year colleges, and joining the armed forces. Specifically, attending a technical/vocational school and graduating from a two year college, serving in the armed forces and graduating from a four year college, and if it is more common to attend a two-year or four-year college are discussed.</p>
