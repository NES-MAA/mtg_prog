Specifically, attending a technical/vocational school and graduating from a two year college, serving in the armed forces and graduating from a four year college, and if it is more common to attend a two-year or four-year college are discussed.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-4.html#paragraphs-12">in-context</a></span>
