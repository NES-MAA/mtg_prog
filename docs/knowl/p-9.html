<p>Bio: Henry Segerman is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Oklahoma State University.  He received his masters in mathematics from the University of Oxford in 2001, and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Stanford University in 2007. After post-doctoral positions at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Melbourne, he joined the faculty at Oklahoma State University in 2013. His research interests are in three-dimensional geometry and topology, working mostly on triangulations of three-manifolds, and in mathematical art and visualization. In visualization, he works mostly in the medium of 3D printing, with other interests in spherical video, virtual, and augmented reality. He is the author of "Visualizing Mathematics with 3D Printing‚Äù, a popular mathematics book published by Johns Hopkins University Press in July 2016.</p>
