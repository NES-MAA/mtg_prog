<article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-3"><p id="p-14">5:10—5:20   Title: Tossing a Coin over the Telephone</p>
<p id="p-15">Speaker: Andy Penfield, Keene State College</p>
<p id="p-16">Abstract: There are many examples of social situations where flipping a coin is used as a method to determine randomly a choice between two options. However if two people talking on the telephone need to make that decision then flipping a physical coin won’t work because both people will not be able to witness the toss. A method for making a decision between two choices without the physical presence of both will be presented along with a mathematical justification for why it works.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-4"><p id="p-17">5:22—5:32   Title: The Kolakoski Sequence</p>
<p id="p-18">Speaker: Kegan Landfair, Keene State College</p>
<p id="p-19">Abstract: The Kolakoski sequence is an infinite, self-determined sequence of 1's and 2's. The sequence does not repeat and contains at most 2 consecutive identical terms. There are many open questions involving the Kolakoski sequence including the question as to whether or not the sequence, in the long run, has a one to one ratio of 1's to 2's. Geometric ways of representing the sequence will be discussed.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-5"><p id="p-20">5:34—5:44   Title: Fourier Coefficients of Squigonometric Functions</p>
<p id="p-21">Speaker: Rye Howard-Stone, Southern Connecticut State University</p>
<p id="p-22">Abstract: The cosine and sine functions keep track of the x and y components of a point in motion at uniform speed around the Unit Circle. If we replace the Unit Circle with the Unit Squircle  we get analogous functions called 'cosquine' and 'squine.' Several authors have studied these functions. The derivatives, and thus the Taylor Series, are readily computable. We decided to explore them via Fourier Analysis. The analytic approach was intractable, so we used numerical integration.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-6"><p id="p-23">5:46—5:56   Title: Soddyian Triangles</p>
<p id="p-24">Speaker: Jeff Garand, Keene State College</p>
<p id="p-25">Abstract: Three circles are configured so that each pair has exactly one point in common. From this two more circles can be constructed, tangent to the given three, which we call the inner and outer Soddy circles. A Soddyian triangle is defined as a triangle whose outer Soddy circle degenerates into a straight line. This talk will examine properties of these triangles.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-7"><p id="p-26">5:58—6:08   Title: Arbelos and Their Generalizations</p>
<p id="p-27">Speaker: Derek Blunt, Keene State College</p>
<p id="p-28">Abstract: An arbelos is a planar region bounded by three mutually tangent semicircles whose diameters all lay on the same line. Many interesting properties of this shape were discovered by Archimedes over 2000 years ago. This talk will explore the properties of the arbelos and then generalize to figures bounded by similar curves such as parabolas.</p></article></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-2"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-8"><p id="p-29">5:10—5:20   Title: Symbolic Computations Course at WestConn: A Mathematical Tour with Computer Assistance</p>
<p id="p-30">Speaker: Leah Lalama, Western Connecticut State University</p>
<p id="p-31">Abstract: The current version of this new interdisciplinary course is designed as a review of basic concepts, selected facts, and techniques from three mathematical fields: number theory, probability and statistics, and calculus. The main distinguished feature of the course is an intensive hands-on use of a computer algebra system (currently Maple) for creating visual displays and animations, performing tedious simulations, and problem solving. We will present examples of the course materials and comment on possible alterations of the course and the ongoing textbook project.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-9"><p id="p-32">5:22—5:32   Title: When Mathematics Meets Physics: Kepler’s problem.</p>
<p id="p-33">Speaker: Joshua Torres, Western Connecticut State University</p>
<p id="p-34">Abstract: In 1609 Kepler presented his three famous laws of motion for a planet traveling around the sun. Later Newton verified Kepler’s laws using his famous inverse square law of gravity. I will describe the problem formulation and rich set of mathematical tools used for its analysis. Verification of the second Kepler’s law and relevant visual displays will be also presented. The project is part of the course work in a new course Symbolic Computation at Western Connecticut State University.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-10"><p id="p-35">5:34—5:44   Title: What are the true effects of smoking?</p>
<p id="p-36">Speaker: Kasandra Kelley, Eastern Connecticut State University</p>
<p id="p-37">Abstract: In the past few years’ people have been trying to cut down on smoking habits for health reasons. It seems to be one of the hardest habits to break for people. So what causes people to smoke so much? In this study we are trying to figure out the relationship between smoking habits, gender and race. We are also curious to see if the hours someone works a week affects how much someone has smoked.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-11"><p id="p-38">5:46—5:56   Title: Drink a Little or Drink a Lot</p>
<p id="p-39">Speaker: Lisa Ferrari, Eastern Connecticut State University</p>
<p id="p-40">Abstract: Alcohol is traditionally viewed as a norm of American society. However, there is a gap in research regarding the effects of location and gender based on alcohol consumption for different periods of time. For example, is alcohol consumption related to living in rural or urban communities? Are men more likely to drink than woman?</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-12"><p id="p-41">5:58—6:08   Title: High School Graduate Goals</p>
<p id="p-42">Speaker: Nicole Vigorita, Eastern Connecticut State University</p>
<p id="p-43">Abstract: This is a statistical analysis studying the relationships between attendance at technical/vocational schools, two-year colleges, four-year colleges, and joining the armed forces. Specifically, attending a technical/vocational school and graduating from a two year college, serving in the armed forces and graduating from a four year college, and if it is more common to attend a two-year or four-year college are discussed.</p></article></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-3"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-13"><p id="p-44">5:10—5:20   Title: A Generalization of Higher Dimension Fibonacci Matrices and Their Graphs</p>
<p id="p-45">Speaker: Zachery Lancto, Westfield State University</p>
<p id="p-46">Abstract: The \(2 \times 2\) Fibonacci matrix is well-studied in mathematics. The concept of the Fibonacci matrix and its associated graph can easily be extended to higher dimensions using concepts and techniques from linear algebra, graph theory, and discrete mathematics. We define  \(n \times n\) Virahanka matrices as the generalization of the Fibonacci matrix. A Virahanka matrix has the property that, when raised to integer powers, all its entries are Fibonacci numbers. We examine \(n \times n\) Virahanka matrices where and discuss their underlying graphs and recurrence relationships.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-14"><p id="p-47">5:22—5:32   Title: Musical Exploratory Data Analysis</p>
<p id="p-48">Speaker: Rachael Fountain, Westfield State University</p>
<p id="p-49">Abstract: Music is so much more than just the notes, pitches, and beats we hear. In fact there are surprising connections between music and mathematics that can be uncovered through exploratory data analysis. In this presentation we will discuss how we used EDA to create two visual graphics which we call will variability graphs and contour graphs. These graphics will then be used in combination with statistics and real analysis to investigate the relationship between musical melodies and mathematics.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-15"><p id="p-50">5:34—5:44   Title: Minimal Forcing Set Algorithm: A Study of Origami</p>
<p id="p-51">Speaker: Tianna Procon, Western New England University</p>
<p id="p-52">Abstract: This presentation explores single-vertex folds of varying degrees and their respective minimal forcing sets as follows: each crease is assigned to be either a mountain or a valley fold. Then, a minimal forcing set is the fewest number of creases needed to force the mountain-valley assignment of the remaining creases. Doing this research we hope to form an algorithm allowing one to find the minimal forcing set of creases for any single-vertex fold without needing to exhaust all possibilities.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-16"><p id="p-53">5:46—5:56   Title: It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's a Satellite! Part A</p>
<p id="p-54">Speaker: Taylor Bigos, Westfield State University</p>
<p id="p-55">Abstract: Origami is a new and exciting research field, with intriguing applications in space and space exploration. This talk encompasses the basic mathematics of Gaussian Curvature and the application of folding rigid origami models and how a group of scientists and mathematicians are relating the mathematics to satellite construction and space exploration.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-17"><p id="p-56">5:58—6:08   Title: It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's a Satellite! Part B</p>
<p id="p-57">Speaker: Autumn Phaneuf, Westfield State University</p>
<p id="p-58">Abstract: This talk will incorporate an active learning component where members of the audience will be invited to construct origami models mentioned in the Part A talk of “It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's a Satellite!” Examples of positive, negative, and zero curvature will be explored.</p></article></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-4"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
