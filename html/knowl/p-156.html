<p>My name is Eric Ruggieri and I am very excited for an opportunity to serve as your Vice Chair this coming year! I graduated from Providence College in 2005, majoring in both mathematics and computer science, and then received my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Brown University in 2010. [While at Brown, I was also part of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology, but ended up writing my dissertation on change point models in climate.] After spending three years at Duquesne University, I joined the faculty at the College of the Holy Cross in 2013. At Holy Cross, I mainly teach courses in Statistics and have served as our department's actuarial advisor for the last several years. [One of my favorite courses is Statistical Computing, which has a heavy focus on simulation, but I've also really enjoyed the Bayesian Statistics course that we are offering for the first time this semester.] For the last three years, I have served as co-coordinator of the NES's Collegiate Math Competition which takes place annually at our Fall Meeting. I am also a member of the national MAA committee CUS (Committee on Undergraduate Students) which helps to organize student activities at both JMM and MathFest. More specifically, I have served as co-coordinator for both the student poster session at JMM and the student paper session at MathFest since 2017.</p>
