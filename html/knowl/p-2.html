<p>There are several activities in addition to talks which we hope you will enjoy.  There is a small display of mathematics-related artwork  in the Fireside Cafe in the Wolak Library.  While in the Wolak library, you are invited to tour SNHU's Maker Space.  Braxton Carrigan is leading a MaPP Puzzle Hunt (sort of a mathematician's scavenger hunt) on Friday afternoon.  There will also be a demonstration of how to lead a Math Circle (a very effective outreach activity for High School students and their Teachers) on Friday.  On Saturday look for another installment of the Teaching Ideas Hour hosted by Vince Ferlini.</p>
