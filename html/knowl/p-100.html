<p>Alan Turing was a British mathematician and computer scientist who is very well-known for breaking the Enigma code, but had made significant amounts of contributions to mathematics, artificial intelligence, morphogenesis and computer science. We will briefly look at his major contributions, an overview of his homosexuality, his lifestyle, and his death.</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Star Chromatic Indices of Cycles and Complete Graphs</em></p>
<p>In this talk, we look at edge colorings, which are the assignment of colors to the edges of a graph where two adjacent edges cannot be the same color. Specifically we will discuss the star chromatic index, the minimum number of colors needed to color a proper edge coloring of a graph where any path of four cannot be colored with only two colors. We present results on the star chromatic index for cycles and complete graphs.  (Advisor: Addie Armstrong)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Cribbage: Counting Techniques, Partitions &amp; Generating Functions</em></p>
<p>The card game cribbage has been used in the classroom as a way to enhance mental math skills at the K-12 and postsecondary levels. At the elementary level, educators can introduce their students to number sense by having them find pairs of cards that sum to fifteen, as obtaining fifteens is a crucial way to earn points in the game. In this talk, we will take a deeper look at the different ways to sum to fifteen in the context of the game of cribbage. We will encounter counting techniques, including partitions and generating functions, which will help us to discover the 10,540 different ways that a sum of fifteen could appear in a cribbage hand.

<p><em class="emphasis">Difference Equations and Their Dynamics</em></p>
<p>Difference equations describe the evolution of a quantity or population whose changes are measured over discrete time intervals. In this presentation, we will investigate these types of recursive relations and classify the local stability of their fixed points and periodic solutions. In particular, we will examine the dynamics of the logistic map and the long-term behavior that occurs when we modify its parameter.  (Advisor: Elliott Bertrand)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Special Sets of Vertices in Paley Graphs</em></p>
<p>Strongly regular graphs have three distinct eigenvalues that give bounds on the average degree of an induced subgraph. Tight sets are sets of vertices that induce a subgraph with as many or as few edges as possible relative to the parameters and eigenvalues of the graph. A particular family of examples of strongly regular graphs is the Paley Graph \(P(q)\text{,}\) which has the finite field of size \(q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\)  as its vertex set, where two vertices are adjacent when their difference is a nonzero perfect square in the considered field.</p>
<p>Motivated by a 1984 result by Blockhuis, we consider the connection between Paley graphs \(P(q^2)\) and finite affine planes. In this model, each line of the affine plane represents either a clique or an independent set in the graph. Selecting only those lines which correspond to cliques, we construct a partial affine plane in which two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if they are on the same line in the affine plane. This allows us to examine tight sets of \(P(q^2)\) in a geometric context. We work towards classifying the tight sets which are not the disjoint union of smaller tight sets.
