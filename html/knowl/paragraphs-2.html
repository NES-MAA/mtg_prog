<p>Linear Algebra Meets Probability and Statistics: A Short Introduction to Random Matrix Theory</p>
<p>(Distinguished Teacher Lecture: Saturday November 17, 2018, 9:00 AM)</p>
<p>The study of random matrices is an active and exciting area of mathematics and has numerous applications to theoretical physics, number theory, optimal control, and finance. Random Matrix Theory provides understanding of various properties (most notably, statistics of eigenvalues) of matrices with random coefficients. We will discuss some of the topics and ideas from Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, and Numerical Analysis that are of central importance in Random Matrix Theory. We will also mention a few of the most important theorems in this area of mathematics and present a couple of new results obtained in joint work with undergraduate students.</p>
<p>Bio: Mihai Stoiciu received his undergraduate degree in Mathematics at the University of Bucharest, he then moved to the U.S. in order to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics at Caltech.  In 2005, after finishing his Ph.D., he started working at Williams College, where he is now a Professor of Mathematics.  Stoiciu's research is in Mathematical Physics and Functional Analysis, his current interests are in spectral theory and random matrices.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-3.html#paragraphs-2">in-context</a></span>
