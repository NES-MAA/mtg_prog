<p>Knot Theory is branch of Topology that studies mathematical knots. Space Harmony is a vast philosophical, creative, and metaphysical view on the nature of human physical reality. It is studied by  artist who are interested in creating movements that have a feeling of balance and harmony. In this talk, we explore the relationship between these two seemingly unrelated fields and demonstrate some of the contributions that they make to one another. Specifically, we demonstrate how knot embeddings in Platonic solids can lead to interesting choreography.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-5.html#paragraphs-33">in-context</a></span>
