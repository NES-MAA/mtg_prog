<p>Motivated by a 1984 result by Blockhuis, we consider the connection between Paley graphs \(P(q^2)\) and finite affine planes. In this model, each line of the affine plane represents either a clique or an independent set in the graph. Selecting only those lines which correspond to cliques, we construct a partial affine plane in which two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if they are on the same line in the affine plane. This allows us to examine tight sets of \(P(q^2)\) in a geometric context. We work towards classifying the tight sets which are not the disjoint union of smaller tight sets.
