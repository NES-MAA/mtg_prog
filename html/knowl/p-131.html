<p>In this report, we seek to find out more about student understanding of series convergence in second semester calculus courses. The research in this area is thin, and we hope to contribute to the existing literature by examining student errors and what these errors tell us about students’ prerequisite knowledge. This report finds that students have difficulty with algebraic simplification of rational functions, limit notation, checking that hypotheses of theorems are satisfied, and what the conclusion of theorems tell them.</p></article>

<p></p>
<p>Joe Fields   —   Southern CT State University</p>
<p>The real projective plane (\({\mathbb R}P^2\)) is a non-orientable 2-manifold that is notoriously hard to visualize and understand.  Using paper models, computer visualizations, 3d printing and lots of hand waving, I'll attempt to give you an intuitive understanding of this odd topological beast.  We'll proceed from the well-known Mobius strip, to the Klein bottle, to cross-caps and some beautiful immersions of \({\mathbb R}P^2\) into 3-space: Steiner's Roman surface, and Boy's surface.</p></article>

<p>A \((a,b)\)-Sudoku pair latin square is a latin square that is simultaneously a \((a,b)\)-Sudoku latin square and a \((b,a)\)-Sudoku latin square. We will provide constructions for many arbitrary classes of positive integer pairs. Specifically we can construct a \((3,b)\)-Sudoku pair latin square for any positive integer \(b\text{.}\) Moreover, this implies that there exist factor pair latin squares of order \(3p\) for any prime \(p\text{,}\) answering a question posed by Hammer and Hoffman.</p></article>
