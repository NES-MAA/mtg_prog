<p>Strongly regular graphs have three distinct eigenvalues that give bounds on the average degree of an induced subgraph. Tight sets are sets of vertices that induce a subgraph with as many or as few edges as possible relative to the parameters and eigenvalues of the graph. A particular family of examples of strongly regular graphs is the Paley Graph \(P(q)\text{,}\) which has the finite field of size \(q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\)  as its vertex set, where two vertices are adjacent when their difference is a nonzero perfect square in the considered field.</p>
