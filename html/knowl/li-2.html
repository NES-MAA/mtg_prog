<p>The goal of this project is to identify if there is a reliable way to gamble on the results of NFL football games. Gambling sites and Vegas use a point spread and adjust according to public opinion in order to mitigate risk on each game. Using the efforts of both teams as explanatory variables, is it possible to predict the winner of the point spread before the game occurs? Considering statistics like offensive yards per game, turnovers or sacks can likely predict the winner and loser of a football game, it is anticipated that there is a regression model with a set of explanatory variables that should be able to profit in gambling against the point spread over the course of a season.
