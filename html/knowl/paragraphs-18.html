<p><em class="emphasis">Matroid + Groups = ?</em></p>
<p>What happens when we form a combination of the algebraic structure of a group with the combinatorial structure of a matroid? The matroid is a mathematical abstraction that emerged from linear algebra but soon was developed throughout many other areas, namely; graph theory, combinatorics, and topology. Groups have been well defined in abstract algebra as a set of elements with a defined binary operation satisfying closure, invertibility, identity, and associativity. This presentation will investigate the intersection of these two structures.
