<p>Speaker: Andy Penfield, Keene State College</p>
<p>Abstract: There are many examples of social situations where flipping a coin is used as a method to determine randomly a choice between two options. However if two people talking on the telephone need to make that decision then flipping a physical coin won’t work because both people will not be able to witness the toss. A method for making a decision between two choices without the physical presence of both will be presented along with a mathematical justification for why it works.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-4.html#paragraphs-3">in-context</a></span>
