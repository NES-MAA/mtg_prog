<p>Thinking Deeply about Putting Numbers in Boxes: Sudoku, Latin Squares, Room squares and designing tournaments</p>
<p>(Invited Address: Saturday, November 17, 2018, 1:00 PM)</p>
<p>A well-known mathematician and educator, Arnold Ross, had a favorite saying about doing mathematics: Think deeply about simple things.  My area of mathematics is called combinatorial design theory, and in my sub-specialty I often find myself trying to construct arrays of numbers which satisfy certain properties (I tell people that my job is putting numbers in boxes).  An example of such an array would be a Sudoku square.  Here, one property is that each row and each column contain each of the symbols 1 through 9 exactly once. In this talk, I will discuss some of the combinatorial objects that I have studied through the years.  I will try to convey some of the deep questions that are asked about these objects and will also give some offbeat applications of them to music, art, and the scheduling of league tournaments.</p>
<p>Bio:  Jeff Dinitz received his Ph.D. in mathematics from The Ohio State University in 1980 and has been on the faculty of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Vermont since 1980. He was the chair of that department from 1998 — 2004 as well as the Interim Chair of the Department of Computer Science from 2010 — 2012. His research is in the area of combinatorial design theory where he has published roughly 100 research articles. He is also the co-editor-in-chief of the CRC Handbook of Combinatorial Designs and of the Journal of Combinatorial Designs. He loves living in Vermont where he enjoys outdoor activities such as sailing, bicycling and skiing.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-3.html#paragraphs-3">in-context</a></span>
