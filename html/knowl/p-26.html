<p>Quality access to food and housing is a widely spread problem for students at Worcester State University, and their affects creep into the classroom to impact students grades. This paper will define the overarching issue of basic needs insecurities, provide analysis of student data from Worcester State University, and suggest actions that will be taken to reduce the impact of these insecurities. Through this analysis, I will determine which demographics are impacted most and what level of impact basic needs insecurities have on grades. This paper will use three major statistical test, a Fisher Exact test, Linear Regression, and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation test. Similar analyses have been conducted through colleges throughout Massachusetts due to the prevalence and importance of basic needs insecurities. This paper will add another level of understanding to this issue, and provide support for programs to help.  (Advisor: Jason Hardin)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Testing the Efficiency of the Gambling Market for the NFL</em></p>
<p>The goal of this project is to identify if there is a reliable way to gamble on the results of NFL football games. Gambling sites and Vegas use a point spread and adjust according to public opinion in order to mitigate risk on each game. Using the efforts of both teams as explanatory variables, is it possible to predict the winner of the point spread before the game occurs? Considering statistics like offensive yards per game, turnovers or sacks can likely predict the winner and loser of a football game, it is anticipated that there is a regression model with a set of explanatory variables that should be able to profit in gambling against the point spread over the course of a season.

<p><em class="emphasis">The Road to College Calculus</em></p>
<p>There are several approaches when it comes to studying calculus. Calculus is important because it is a necessary tool for almost all STEM careers. More and more high school students are having the option to take calculus. This paper focuses on data from several studies of students who took calculus in high school. It will give suggestions on the best approach to calculus and how to be successful.  (Advisor: Jason Hardin)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Bayesian and Measure Theoretic Extensions of Generative Adversarial Networks</em></p>
<p>Generative Adversarial Networks are a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms that fit some probability model to a data generating process through a system of two neural networks contesting each other in a zero-sum game framework. This paper discusses extensions of classic GANs in the frameworks of Measure Theory and Bayesian statistical theory.  (Advisor:Jason Hardin)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Random Matrix Theory and the Riemann Zeta Function</em></p>
<p>The talk will cover some introductory concepts in complex analysis in order to discuss the Riemann Zeta Function. Some properties and forms of the function will be demonstrated, so that the Riemann Hypothesis can be discussed. The primary purpose of the project is understanding the Hilbert-Polya conjecture and the possible connection between the distribution of zeros of the RZF and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble.

<p><em class="emphasis">Prime Numbers and Irreducible Polynomials</em></p>
<p>In the study of prime numbers and polynomials it is important to determine which polynomials are irreducible and how such polynomials are related or similar to prime numbers and prime factorization. In this presentation we would be looking at the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, The Divisibility, Remainder Theorem,Greatest Common divisor,Euclid's Algorithm, Irreducible polynomials and some Tests for Irreducible polynomials etc.  (Advisor: Jason Hardin)</p></article>
