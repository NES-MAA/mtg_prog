<p><em class="emphasis">4th Dimensional Geometry</em></p>
<p>Our lives are entirely within a 3rd dimension space even when we can draw and design in 2-dimesnion and 1-dimension space. However, our world holds many more dimensions than just those three. This presentation will go over a 4th space dimension and how we can view objects within that dimension aided by Euler’s Formula and moving visuals. We will also give a brief view of the number system unique to that dimension.  (Advisor: Karen Stanish)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Sandy Numbers + Drawing = Fun Time</em></p>
<p>This presentation will introduce Sona drawings of the Chokwe people and how they can be drawn using permutations. We will use mathematical ideas to answer a simple question of, “Can we draw these drawings without lifting our fingers or changing directions?”   (Advisor: Karen Stanish)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Matroid + Groups = ?</em></p>
<p>What happens when we form a combination of the algebraic structure of a group with the combinatorial structure of a matroid? The matroid is a mathematical abstraction that emerged from linear algebra but soon was developed throughout many other areas, namely; graph theory, combinatorics, and topology. Groups have been well defined in abstract algebra as a set of elements with a defined binary operation satisfying closure, invertibility, identity, and associativity. This presentation will investigate the intersection of these two structures.  (Advisor: Karen Stanish)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Modeling spatial decisions with graph theory: logging roads and forest fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazon</em></p>
<p>This presentation addresses the spatial decision making of loggers and how it effects forest fragmentation in the Amazon basin. It provides a behavioral explanation for fragmentation by modeling how loggers build road networks. We will model how loggers shape their road networks by adapting graph theory to represent the spatial decision-making of loggers, and then implementing computational algorithms that build graphs interpretable as logging road networks.

<p><em class="emphasis">Not All Numbers Can Be Created Equally</em></p>
<p>We take a well-known problem — which number can or cannot be written as a sum of consecutive integers and generalize it for summations involving any arithmetic sequence. Various general and specific theorems involving these summations are proven.  (Advisor: Karen Stanish)</p></article>
