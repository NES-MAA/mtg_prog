<p>Charlotte Angas Scott (1858-1931) was a British algebraic geometer who spent her career at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. She was one of the first women to receive a PhD in mathematics, and she utilized her influence to create opportunities for the women who came after her. This paper studies Scott’s role in women’s higher education in mathematics through her programs at Bryn Mawr, as well as her role in developing the American mathematical community as a whole.
