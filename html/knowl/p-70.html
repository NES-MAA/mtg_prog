<p>Our lives are entirely within a 3rd dimension space even when we can draw and design in 2-dimesnion and 1-dimension space. However, our world holds many more dimensions than just those three. This presentation will go over a 4th space dimension and how we can view objects within that dimension aided by Eulerâ€™s Formula and moving visuals. We will also give a brief view of the number system unique to that dimension.  (Advisor: Karen Stanish)</p>
