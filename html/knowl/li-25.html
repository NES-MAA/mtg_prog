<p><em class="emphasis">Cribbage: Counting Techniques, Partitions &amp; Generating Functions</em></p>
<p>The card game cribbage has been used in the classroom as a way to enhance mental math skills at the K-12 and postsecondary levels. At the elementary level, educators can introduce their students to number sense by having them find pairs of cards that sum to fifteen, as obtaining fifteens is a crucial way to earn points in the game. In this talk, we will take a deeper look at the different ways to sum to fifteen in the context of the game of cribbage. We will encounter counting techniques, including partitions and generating functions, which will help us to discover the 10,540 different ways that a sum of fifteen could appear in a cribbage hand.
