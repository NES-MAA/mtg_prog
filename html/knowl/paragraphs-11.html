<p>Water is the only natural substance that exists in three fundamental states – solid, liquid, and gas at the normal range of temperatures found near the surface of earth. Enormous researches on water have been conducted. However, there is still a lot more to be understood at the nanoscale (molecular scale) level.</p>
<p>We present our study on the dynamics of water molecules in the process of water’s state change from ice (solid) to liquid water using a popular computer simulation method called Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation.  In this talk, we will introduce the mathematics behind the MD simulation and discuss some of the key analysis result from our work.
