<p>Quality access to food and housing is a widely spread problem for students at Worcester State University, and their affects creep into the classroom to impact students grades. This paper will define the overarching issue of basic needs insecurities, provide analysis of student data from Worcester State University, and suggest actions that will be taken to reduce the impact of these insecurities. Through this analysis, I will determine which demographics are impacted most and what level of impact basic needs insecurities have on grades. This paper will use three major statistical test, a Fisher Exact test, Linear Regression, and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation test. Similar analyses have been conducted through colleges throughout Massachusetts due to the prevalence and importance of basic needs insecurities. This paper will add another level of understanding to this issue, and provide support for programs to help.
