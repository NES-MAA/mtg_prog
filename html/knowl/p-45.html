<p><em class="emphasis">Minimal Tile and Bond-Edge Types for Self-Assembling DNA Graphs of Triangular Tiles</em></p>
<p>We examine self-assembling DNA from a graph theory perspective based on the tile model. These tiles represent junction branched molecules whose arms are double strands of DNA. We consider a family of graphs obtained by a string of connected triangles. Given a target graph G, a pot of tiles is designed in order to achieve G in three different scenarios corresponding to distinct levels of laboratory constraints. In the first scenario, graphs of a smaller size than G are allowed. In the second scenario, nonisomorphic graphs of the same size as G are allowed, but not graphs of smaller size. In the third scenario, only graphs isomorphic or larger in size to the target graph are allowed. We find the minimum number of tile types and bond-edge types for each of the three scenarios.

<p><em class="emphasis">How Ice Melts: Exploring Molecular Level Dynamics</em></p>
<p>Water is the only natural substance that exists in three fundamental states – solid, liquid, and gas at the normal range of temperatures found near the surface of earth. Enormous researches on water have been conducted. However, there is still a lot more to be understood at the nanoscale (molecular scale) level.</p>
<p>We present our study on the dynamics of water molecules in the process of water’s state change from ice (solid) to liquid water using a popular computer simulation method called Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation.  In this talk, we will introduce the mathematics behind the MD simulation and discuss some of the key analysis result from our work.  (Advisor: Jane Lee)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Visual Gems of Number Theory</em></p>
<p>Many of the theorems that we prove in Number Theory can be represented in a visual way. For example, we can show facts about triangular numbers using dots and forming them into a triangle. In this presentation, we shall explain some of these visual proofs and talk about how they could be used in a middle school classroom.  (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Repunits and Arithmetic Progressions</em></p>
<p>There are many different aspects in mathematics that still need to be investigated further. This talk will focus around repunits and arithmetic progressions. A repunit is a positive integer in the form of kkk…kkk where k is any non-zero digit. In this talk, we shall explore these repunits in connection with arithmetic progressions. We shall also see how to classify and determine when a sequence has repunits and allude to the idea of why some sequences do not have any repunits. (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Repeating Integer Paradox</em></p>
<p>The decimal representation for the fraction \(1/3\) is \(0.3333\ldots = 0.\overline{3} \) where the three dots and the bar above the 3 each indicate that the threes continue without end. This repetition of digits can be done in the other direction to create \(\ldots3333\) represented by \(\overleftarrow{3}\text{.}\) This does not look like any natural number since there are infinitely many threes. In this presentation, we use some of the same techniques used in showing the relationship between \(1/3\) and \(\overline{3}\) along with some modular ten arithmetic to give meaning to \(\overleftarrow{3}\) and other repeating integers having this form.

<p><em class="emphasis">HS Sequences</em></p>
<p>A sequence of nonnegative integers begins with 2 followed by 3. The product is 6 and the sequence now becomes 2, 3, 6 . The next product 3×6=18 creates two values 1 and 8 and the sequence is extended to 2, 3, 6, 1, 8 . The next product 6×1=6 results in 2, 3, 6, 1, 8, 6 . The sequence will continue infinitely in this manner because each multiplication produces a single or double-digit nonnegative integer, so either one or two values will always be added on the “tail” of the sequence. This sequence first appeared in a problem devised by Hugo Steinhaus. A sequence generated in this way can begin with any two nonnegative single digits and it will be referred to as an HS sequence. This talk will analyze the long-term behavior of these sequences.  (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p></article>
