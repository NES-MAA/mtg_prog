<p><em class="emphasis">Broadening the Field: Charlotte Angas Scott and Women’s Mathematical Education</em></p>
<p>Charlotte Angas Scott (1858-1931) was a British algebraic geometer who spent her career at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. She was one of the first women to receive a PhD in mathematics, and she utilized her influence to create opportunities for the women who came after her. This paper studies Scott’s role in women’s higher education in mathematics through her programs at Bryn Mawr, as well as her role in developing the American mathematical community as a whole.

<p><em class="emphasis">Multivariate statistical models and their application to the study of adolescent alcohol use</em></p>
<p>I used binary logistic regression to construct a model to answer the question: which variables among region, urbanicity, number of parents in a household, parental education level, religiosity, marijuana use, and gender predict adolescent alcohol use? I used the 2015 12th Grade Monitoring the Future dataset to construct a model which predicts the likelihood of an adolescent using alcohol. I concluded that the model including gender, marijuana use, urbanicity, mother education level, and religiosity significantly predicts adolescent alcohol use.  (Advisor: Peter Johnson)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Determining the Number of \(LU\) Decompositions of Matrices in \(M_2(\Z_n)\)</em></p>
<p>We expand the definition of \(LU\) decomposition to explore decompositions of matrices in \(M_2(\Z_n)\text{.}\) Focusing on matrices in \(M_2(\Z_n)\text{,}\) we determine a case when there are never any decompositions. Some matrices have multiple decompositions with the expanded definition. Focusing on matrices in \(M_2(\Z_p)\text{,}\) we pursue an upper and lower bound of the number of decompositions. We find a specific number of decompositions for the identity matrix in \(M_2(\Z_p)\text{.}\)  (Advisor: Emma Wright)</p></article>

<p><em class="emphasis">Octal Games of Node-Kayles</em></p>
<p>Can two games with different rules really be the same game? The classic game of Nim can be generalized to a broader category of "taking and breaking" games called octal games. A seemingly dissimilar game is Node-Kayles, which is a two player game based on coloring nodes of a graph. We investigate when, why, and how games of Node-Kayles can be octal games, and what it means for Node-Kayles on a graph to be an octal game.</p></article>
