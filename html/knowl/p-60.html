<p>There are many different aspects in mathematics that still need to be investigated further. This talk will focus around repunits and arithmetic progressions. A repunit is a positive integer in the form of kkkâ€¦kkk where k is any non-zero digit. In this talk, we shall explore these repunits in connection with arithmetic progressions. We shall also see how to classify and determine when a sequence has repunits and allude to the idea of why some sequences do not have any repunits. (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p>
