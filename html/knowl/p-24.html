<p>A well-known mathematician and educator, Arnold Ross, had a favorite saying about doing mathematics: Think deeply about simple things.  My area of mathematics is called combinatorial design theory, and in my sub-specialty I often find myself trying to construct arrays of numbers which satisfy certain properties (I tell people that my job is putting numbers in boxes).  An example of such an array would be a Sudoku square.  Here, one property is that each row and each column contain each of the symbols 1 through 9 exactly once. In this talk, I will discuss some of the combinatorial objects that I have studied through the years.  I will try to convey some of the deep questions that are asked about these objects and will also give some offbeat applications of them to music, art, and the scheduling of league tournaments.</p>
