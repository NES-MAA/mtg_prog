<p>A sequence of nonnegative integers begins with 2 followed by 3. The product is 6 and the sequence now becomes 2, 3, 6 . The next product 3×6=18 creates two values 1 and 8 and the sequence is extended to 2, 3, 6, 1, 8 . The next product 6×1=6 results in 2, 3, 6, 1, 8, 6 . The sequence will continue infinitely in this manner because each multiplication produces a single or double-digit nonnegative integer, so either one or two values will always be added on the “tail” of the sequence. This sequence first appeared in a problem devised by Hugo Steinhaus. A sequence generated in this way can begin with any two nonnegative single digits and it will be referred to as an HS sequence. This talk will analyze the long-term behavior of these sequences.  (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p>
