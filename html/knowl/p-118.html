<p></p>
<p>Santhosh Mathew	    —    Regis College</p>
<p>(with Upasana Kashyap, Regis College)</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the correlation between the ACCUPLACER placement test score (elementary algebra) and the student success in the quantitative reasoning course at Regis College. Our study point to a weak correlation between the ACCUPLACER placement score and the student success in the quantitative reasoning course. We propose that an in-house placement system based on the unique requirements of the institution will be a much more pragmatic approach to place the students at appropriate levels of instruction.</p></article>

<p></p>
<p>Sean Bailey   —   University of Southern Maine</p>
<p>(with Garry Wickerd    —    University of Southern Maine)</p>
<p>One factor impacting student performance is their perception of math. Using Attitudes Toward Mathematics Inventory, we determined student perception of math in a variety of developmental and introductory math courses. We will share the results and the implications, including a comparison between different classes.</p></article>

<p></p>
<p>Mehdi Khorami    —   ECSU</p>
<p>(with Marie Percy, University of Connecticut, Department of Dramatic Arts)</p>
<p>Knot Theory is branch of Topology that studies mathematical knots. Space Harmony is a vast philosophical, creative, and metaphysical view on the nature of human physical reality. It is studied by  artist who are interested in creating movements that have a feeling of balance and harmony. In this talk, we explore the relationship between these two seemingly unrelated fields and demonstrate some of the contributions that they make to one another. Specifically, we demonstrate how knot embeddings in Platonic solids can lead to interesting choreography.</p></article>
