<p>Title: Topics and Pedagogical Techniques for Undergraduate Research</p>
<p>
 Abstract: During the last twelve years I had the privilege to advise several undergraduate research projects, including senior theses, summer REU programs, and semester projects. I would like to share a few thoughts on undergraduate research, in particular on  choosing appropriate topics and on guiding the students throughout the research process. We will discuss a few concrete examples from the work done in Linear Algebra, Probability, and Random Matrix Theory by undergraduate students during the Summer of 2018 in the "SMALL" Undergraduate Research Program at Williams College.</p>
