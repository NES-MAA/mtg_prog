    <p><bold>5:10<mdash/>5:20 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Tossing a Coin over the Telephone</p>

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Andy Penfield, Keene State College</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> There are many examples of social situations where flipping a coin is used as a 
    method to determine randomly a choice between two options. However if two people talking on the telephone 
    need to make that decision then flipping a physical coin won’t work because both people will not be able 
    to witness the toss. A method for making a decision between two choices without the physical presence of 
    both will be presented along with a mathematical justification for why it works. </p>

    <p><bold>5:22<mdash/>5:32 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> The Kolakoski Sequence</p>

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Kegan Landfair, Keene State College</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> The Kolakoski sequence is an infinite, self-determined sequence of 1's and 2's. 
    The sequence does not repeat and contains at most 2 consecutive identical terms. There are many open 
    questions involving the Kolakoski sequence including the question as to whether or not the sequence, in 
    the long run, has a one to one ratio of 1's to 2's. Geometric ways of representing the sequence will be 
    discussed.</p>

    <p><bold>5:34<mdash/>5:44 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Fourier Coefficients of Squigonometric Functions</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Rye Howard-Stone, Southern Connecticut State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> The cosine and sine functions keep track of the x and y components of a point in motion at uniform speed 
around the Unit Circle. If we replace the Unit Circle with the Unit Squircle  we get analogous functions 
called 'cosquine' and 'squine.' Several authors have studied these functions. The derivatives, and thus 
the Taylor Series, are readily computable. We decided to explore them via Fourier Analysis. The analytic 
approach was intractable, so we used numerical integration.

    <p><bold>5:46<mdash/>5:56 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Soddyian Triangles</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Jeff Garand, Keene State College</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> Three circles are configured so that each pair has exactly one point in common.
From this two more circles can be constructed, tangent to the given three, which we call the inner and outer Soddy circles. A Soddyian triangle is defined as a triangle whose outer Soddy circle degenerates into a straight line. This talk will examine properties of these triangles.

    <p><bold>5:58<mdash/>6:08 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Arbelos and Their Generalizations</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Derek Blunt, Keene State College</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> An arbelos is a planar region bounded by three mutually tangent semicircles whose 
    diameters all lay on the same line. Many interesting properties of this shape were discovered by Archimedes 
    over 2000 years ago. This talk will explore the properties of the arbelos and then generalize to figures 
    bounded by similar curves such as parabolas.

    <p><bold>5:10<mdash/>5:20 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Symbolic Computations Course at WestConn: A Mathematical Tour with Computer Assistance </p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Leah Lalama, Western Connecticut State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> The current version of this new interdisciplinary course is designed as a review of basic 
    concepts, selected facts, and techniques from three mathematical fields: number theory, probability and statistics, 
    and calculus. The main distinguished feature of the course is an intensive hands-on use of a computer algebra system 
    (currently Maple) for creating visual displays and animations, performing tedious simulations, and problem solving. 
    We will present examples of the course materials and comment on possible alterations of the course and the ongoing 
    textbook project.

    <p><bold>5:22<mdash/>5:32 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> When Mathematics Meets Physics: Kepler’s problem.</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Joshua Torres, Western Connecticut State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> In 1609 Kepler presented his three famous laws of motion for a planet traveling around 
    the sun. Later Newton verified Kepler’s laws using his famous inverse square law of gravity. I will describe the 
    problem formulation and rich set of mathematical tools used for its analysis. Verification of the second Kepler’s 
    law and relevant visual displays will be also presented. The project is part of the course work in a new course 
    Symbolic Computation at Western Connecticut State University.

    <p><bold>5:34<mdash/>5:44 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> What are the true effects of smoking?</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Kasandra Kelley, Eastern Connecticut State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> In the past few years’ people have been trying to cut down on smoking habits for health 
    reasons. It seems to be one of the hardest habits to break for people. So what causes people to smoke so much? 
    In this study we are trying to figure out the relationship between smoking habits, gender and race. We are also 
    curious to see if the hours someone works a week affects how much someone has smoked.

    <p><bold>5:46<mdash/>5:56 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Drink a Little or Drink a Lot</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Lisa Ferrari, Eastern Connecticut State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> Alcohol is traditionally viewed as a norm of American society. However, there is a gap 
    in research regarding the effects of location and gender based on alcohol consumption for different periods of 
    time. For example, is alcohol consumption related to living in rural or urban communities? Are men more likely 
    to drink than woman?

    <p><bold>5:58<mdash/>6:08 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> High School Graduate Goals</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Nicole Vigorita, Eastern Connecticut State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> This is a statistical analysis studying the relationships between attendance at 
    technical/vocational schools, two-year colleges, four-year colleges, and joining the armed forces. 
    Specifically, attending a technical/vocational school and graduating from a two year college, serving in 
    the armed forces and graduating from a four year college, and if it is more common to attend a two-year or 
    four-year college are discussed.

    <p><bold>5:10<mdash/>5:20 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> A Generalization of Higher Dimension Fibonacci Matrices and Their Graphs</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Zachery Lancto, Westfield State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> The <m>2 \times 2</m> Fibonacci matrix is well-studied in mathematics. The concept of the 
    Fibonacci matrix and its associated graph can easily be extended to higher dimensions using concepts and techniques 
    from linear algebra, graph theory, and discrete mathematics. We define  <m>n \times n</m> Virahanka matrices as the 
    generalization of the Fibonacci matrix. A Virahanka matrix has the property that, when raised to integer powers, all 
    its entries are Fibonacci numbers. We examine <m>n \times n</m> Virahanka matrices where and discuss their underlying 
    graphs and recurrence relationships.

    <p><bold>5:22<mdash/>5:32 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Musical Exploratory Data Analysis</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Rachael Fountain, Westfield State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> Music is so much more than just the notes, pitches, and beats we hear. In fact there are 
    surprising connections between music and mathematics that can be uncovered through exploratory data analysis. In 
    this presentation we will discuss how we used EDA to create two visual graphics which we call will variability 
    graphs and contour graphs. These graphics will then be used in combination with statistics and real analysis to 
    investigate the relationship between musical melodies and mathematics.

    <p><bold>5:34<mdash/>5:44 <nbsp/> Title:</bold> Minimal Forcing Set Algorithm: A Study of Origami</p> 

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Tianna Procon, Western New England University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> This presentation explores single-vertex folds of varying degrees and their 
    respective minimal forcing sets as follows: each crease is assigned to be either a mountain or a valley 
    fold. Then, a minimal forcing set is the fewest number of creases needed to force the mountain-valley 
    assignment of the remaining creases. Doing this research we hope to form an algorithm allowing one to 
    find the minimal forcing set of creases for any single-vertex fold without needing to exhaust all 
    possibilities.

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Taylor Bigos, Westfield State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> Origami is a new and exciting research field, with intriguing applications in space 
    and space exploration. This talk encompasses the basic mathematics of Gaussian Curvature and the application 
    of folding rigid origami models and how a group of scientists and mathematicians are relating the mathematics 
    to satellite construction and space exploration.

    <p><bold>Speaker:</bold> Autumn Phaneuf, Westfield State University</p>

    <p><bold>Abstract:</bold> This talk will incorporate an active learning component where members of the audience 
    will be invited to construct origami models mentioned in the Part A talk of “It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's a Satellite!” Examples of positive, negative, and zero curvature will be explored.
