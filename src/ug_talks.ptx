<p><emph> Multivariate statistical models and their application to the study of adolescent alcohol use</emph></p>

<p>I used binary logistic regression to construct a model to answer the question: which variables among region, urbanicity, number of parents in a household, parental education level, religiosity, marijuana use, and gender predict adolescent alcohol use? I used the 2015 12th Grade Monitoring the Future dataset to construct a model which predicts the likelihood of an adolescent using alcohol. I concluded that the model including gender, marijuana use, urbanicity, mother education level, and religiosity significantly predicts adolescent alcohol use.  (Advisor: Peter Johnson)</p>

<p><emph>Basic Needs Insecurity at Worcester State University</emph></p>

<p>Quality access to food and housing is a widely spread problem for students at Worcester State University, and their affects creep into the classroom to impact students grades. This paper will define the overarching issue of basic needs insecurities, provide analysis of student data from Worcester State University, and suggest actions that will be taken to reduce the impact of these insecurities. Through this analysis, I will determine which demographics are impacted most and what level of impact basic needs insecurities have on grades. This paper will use three major statistical test, a Fisher Exact test, Linear Regression, and Pearson's Product Moment Correlation test. Similar analyses have been conducted through colleges throughout Massachusetts due to the prevalence and importance of basic needs insecurities. This paper will add another level of understanding to this issue, and provide support for programs to help.  (Advisor: Jason Hardin)

<p><emph>Visual Gems of Number Theory</emph></p>

<p>Many of the theorems that we prove in Number Theory can be represented in a visual way. For example, we can show facts about triangular numbers using dots and forming them into a triangle. In this presentation, we shall explain some of these visual proofs and talk about how they could be used in a middle school classroom.  (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p>

<p><emph>4th Dimensional Geometry</emph></p>

<p>Our lives are entirely within a 3rd dimension space even when we can draw and design in 2-dimesnion and 1-dimension space. However, our world holds many more dimensions than just those three. This presentation will go over a 4th space dimension and how we can view objects within that dimension aided by Euler’s Formula and moving visuals. We will also give a brief view of the number system unique to that dimension.  (Advisor: Karen Stanish)</p>

<p><emph>Repunits and Arithmetic Progressions</emph></p>

<p>There are many different aspects in mathematics that still need to be investigated further. This talk will focus around repunits and arithmetic progressions. A repunit is a positive integer in the form of kkk…kkk where k is any non-zero digit. In this talk, we shall explore these repunits in connection with arithmetic progressions. We shall also see how to classify and determine when a sequence has repunits and allude to the idea of why some sequences do not have any repunits. (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p>

<p><emph>Repeating Integer Paradox</emph></p>

<p>The decimal representation for the fraction <m>1/3</m> is <m>0.3333\ldots = 0.\overline{3} </m> where the three dots and the bar above the 3 each indicate that the threes continue without end. This repetition of digits can be done in the other direction to create <m>\ldots3333</m> represented by <m>\overleftarrow{3}</m>. This does not look like any natural number since there are infinitely many threes. In this presentation, we use some of the same techniques used in showing the relationship between <m>1/3</m> and <m>\overline{3}</m> along with some modular ten arithmetic to give meaning to <m>\overleftarrow{3}</m> and other repeating integers having this form.

<p><emph>HS Sequences</emph></p>

<p>A sequence of nonnegative integers begins with 2 followed by 3. The product is 6 and the sequence now becomes 2, 3, 6 . The next product 3×6=18 creates two values 1 and 8 and the sequence is extended to 2, 3, 6, 1, 8 . The next product 6×1=6 results in 2, 3, 6, 1, 8, 6 . The sequence will continue infinitely in this manner because each multiplication produces a single or double-digit nonnegative integer, so either one or two values will always be added on the “tail” of the sequence. This sequence first appeared in a problem devised by Hugo Steinhaus. A sequence generated in this way can begin with any two nonnegative single digits and it will be referred to as an HS sequence. This talk will analyze the long-term behavior of these sequences.  (Advisor: Vincent Ferlini)</p>

<p><emph>Star Chromatic Indices of Cycles and Complete Graphs</emph></p>

<p>In this talk, we look at edge colorings, which are the assignment of colors to the edges of a graph where two adjacent edges cannot be the same color. Specifically we will discuss the star chromatic index, the minimum number of colors needed to color a proper edge coloring of a graph where any path of four cannot be colored with only two colors. We present results on the star chromatic index for cycles and complete graphs.  (Advisor: Addie Armstrong)</p>

<p><emph>Testing the Efficiency of the Gambling Market for the NFL</emph></p>

<p>The goal of this project is to identify if there is a reliable way to gamble on the results of NFL football games. Gambling sites and Vegas use a point spread and adjust according to public opinion in order to mitigate risk on each game. Using the efforts of both teams as explanatory variables, is it possible to predict the winner of the point spread before the game occurs? Considering statistics like offensive yards per game, turnovers or sacks can likely predict the winner and loser of a football game, it is anticipated that there is a regression model with a set of explanatory variables that should be able to profit in gambling against the point spread over the course of a season.

<p><emph>Matroid + Groups = ?</emph></p>

<p>What happens when we form a combination of the algebraic structure of a group with the combinatorial structure of a matroid? The matroid is a mathematical abstraction that emerged from linear algebra but soon was developed throughout many other areas, namely; graph theory, combinatorics, and topology. Groups have been well defined in abstract algebra as a set of elements with a defined binary operation satisfying closure, invertibility, identity, and associativity. This presentation will investigate the intersection of these two structures.  (Advisor: Karen Stanish)</p>

<p><emph>Cribbage: Counting Techniques, Partitions <ampersand /> Generating Functions</emph></p>


<p>The card game cribbage has been used in the classroom as a way to enhance mental math skills at the K-12 and postsecondary levels. At the elementary level, educators can introduce their students to number sense by having them find pairs of cards that sum to fifteen, as obtaining fifteens is a crucial way to earn points in the game. In this talk, we will take a deeper look at the different ways to sum to fifteen in the context of the game of cribbage. We will encounter counting techniques, including partitions and generating functions, which will help us to discover the 10,540 different ways that a sum of fifteen could appear in a cribbage hand.

<p><emph>Modeling spatial decisions with graph theory: logging roads and forest fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazon</emph></p>

<p>This presentation addresses the spatial decision making of loggers and how it effects forest fragmentation in the Amazon basin. It provides a behavioral explanation for fragmentation by modeling how loggers build road networks. We will model how loggers shape their road networks by adapting graph theory to represent the spatial decision-making of loggers, and then implementing computational algorithms that build graphs interpretable as logging road networks.

<p><emph>Determining the Number of <m>LU</m> Decompositions of Matrices in <m>M_2(\Z_n)</m></emph>
</p>
<p>We expand the definition of <m>LU</m> decomposition to explore decompositions of matrices in <m>M_2(\Z_n)</m>. Focusing on matrices in <m>M_2(\Z_n)</m>, we determine a case when there are never any decompositions. Some matrices have multiple decompositions with the expanded definition. Focusing on matrices in <m>M_2(\Z_p)</m>, we pursue an upper and lower bound of the number of decompositions. We find a specific number of decompositions for the identity matrix in <m>M_2(\Z_p)</m>.

<p><emph>Difference Equations and Their Dynamics</emph></p>

<p>Difference equations describe the evolution of a quantity or population whose changes are measured over discrete time intervals. In this presentation, we will investigate these types of recursive relations and classify the local stability of their fixed points and periodic solutions. In particular, we will examine the dynamics of the logistic map and the long-term behavior that occurs when we modify its parameter.  (Advisor: Elliott Bertrand)</p>

<p><emph>Octal Games of Node-Kayles</emph></p>

<p>Can two games with different rules really be the same game? The classic game of Nim can be generalized to a broader category of "taking and breaking" games called octal games. A seemingly dissimilar game is Node-Kayles, which is a two player game based on coloring nodes of a graph. We investigate when, why, and how games of Node-Kayles can be octal games, and what it means for Node-Kayles on a graph to be an octal game.</p>

<p><emph>The Road to College Calculus</emph></p>

<p>There are several approaches when it comes to studying calculus. Calculus is important because it is a necessary tool for almost all STEM careers. More and more high school students are having the option to take calculus. This paper focuses on data from several studies of students who took calculus in high school. It will give suggestions on the best approach to calculus and how to be successful.  (Advisor: Jason Hardin)</p>

<p><emph>Random Matrix Theory and the Riemann Zeta Function</emph></p>

<p>The talk will cover some introductory concepts in complex analysis in order to discuss the Riemann Zeta Function. Some properties and forms of the function will be demonstrated, so that the Riemann Hypothesis can be discussed. The primary purpose of the project is understanding the Hilbert-Polya conjecture and the possible connection between the distribution of zeros of the RZF and the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble.

<p><emph>Special Sets of Vertices in Paley Graphs</emph></p>

<p>Strongly regular graphs have three distinct eigenvalues that give bounds on the average degree of an induced subgraph. Tight sets are sets of vertices that induce a subgraph with as many or as few edges as possible relative to the parameters and eigenvalues of the graph. A particular family of examples of strongly regular graphs is the Paley Graph <m>P(q)</m>, which has the finite field of size <m>q \equiv 1 \pmod{4}</m>  as its vertex set, where two vertices are adjacent when their difference is a nonzero perfect square in the considered field.</p>

<p>Motivated by a 1984 result by Blockhuis, we consider the connection between Paley graphs <m>P(q^2)</m> and finite affine planes. In this model, each line of the affine plane represents either a clique or an independent set in the graph. Selecting only those lines which correspond to cliques, we construct a partial affine plane in which two vertices are adjacent in the graph if and only if they are on the same line in the affine plane. This allows us to examine tight sets of <m>P(q^2)</m> in a geometric context. We work towards classifying the tight sets which are not the disjoint union of smaller tight sets.

<p><emph>How Ice Melts: Exploring Molecular Level Dynamics</emph></p>

<p>Water is the only natural substance that exists in three fundamental states – solid, liquid, and gas at the normal range of temperatures found near the surface of earth. Enormous researches on water have been conducted. However, there is still a lot more to be understood at the nanoscale (molecular scale) level.</p>

<p>We present our study on the dynamics of water molecules in the process of water’s state change from ice (solid) to liquid water using a popular computer simulation method called Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation.  In this talk, we will introduce the mathematics behind the MD simulation and discuss some of the key analysis result from our work.  (Advisor: Jane Lee)</p>

<p><emph>Minimal Tile and Bond-Edge Types for Self-Assembling DNA Graphs of Triangular Tiles</emph></p>

<p>We examine self-assembling DNA from a graph theory perspective based on the tile model. These tiles represent junction branched molecules whose arms are double strands of DNA. We consider a family of graphs obtained by a string of connected triangles. Given a target graph G, a pot of tiles is designed in order to achieve G in three different scenarios corresponding to distinct levels of laboratory constraints. In the first scenario, graphs of a smaller size than G are allowed. In the second scenario, nonisomorphic graphs of the same size as G are allowed, but not graphs of smaller size. In the third scenario, only graphs isomorphic or larger in size to the target graph are allowed. We find the minimum number of tile types and bond-edge types for each of the three scenarios.
